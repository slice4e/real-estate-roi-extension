# Real Estate ROI Calculator Chrome Extension üè†

A sophisticated Chrome browser extension that automatically calculates Return on Investment (ROI) for real estate properties using two distinct investment strategies: **Conventional Financing** and **Cash + HELOC Refinance**. Designed for Redfin and Zillow listing pages.

**Version 1.1** features dramatically improved code quality with a professional class-based architecture, enhanced property data extraction including insurance costs, while maintaining 100% of the original functionality.

## üöÄ Key Features

### **Dual Investment Strategy Analysis**
- **Conventional Financing**: Traditional mortgage-based investment analysis
- **Cash + HELOC Refinance**: Advanced BRRRR (Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat) strategy with HELOC financing

### **Intelligent Target Price Optimization**
- **Binary Search Algorithm**: Automatically calculates optimal purchase price for 10% ROI target
- **Strategy-Specific Pricing**: Separate target prices for each investment strategy
- **Manual Override**: Users can enter custom purchase prices to override auto-calculations

### **Automatic Data Extraction**
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works on both Redfin and Zillow property listings
- **Smart Property Detection**: Automatically extracts asking price, annual property taxes, and homeowners insurance
- **Payment Calculator Integration**: Advanced extraction from mortgage payment calculators for accurate tax and insurance data
- **Fallback Tax Estimation**: Uses 1.5% estimation when tax data unavailable
- **Insurance Auto-Population**: Extracted insurance values automatically populate form fields and override defaults

### **Advanced ARV Calculations**
- **HELOC Strategy Only**: ARV = Purchase Price + (2 √ó Improvement Costs)
- **Auto-Update Logic**: ARV recalculates when target purchase price changes
- **Manual Entry Preservation**: Respects user-entered ARV values

## üìä Investment Strategy Details

### **Strategy 1: Conventional Financing**
Traditional real estate investment approach using mortgage financing.

**Calculation Flow:**
1. **Purchase with Financing**: Down payment + mortgage
2. **Renovation Period**: Hold property during improvements
3. **Rental Income**: Generate monthly cash flow
4. **ROI Analysis**: Annual cash flow √∑ total cash invested

### **Strategy 2: Cash + HELOC Refinance (BRRRR)**
Advanced strategy using all-cash purchase followed by refinance.

**Calculation Flow:**
1. **Cash Purchase**: Buy property with 100% cash
2. **HELOC Financing**: Fund improvements with Home Equity Line of Credit
3. **Renovation Period**: Complete improvements (2-6 months)
4. **Seasoning Period**: Wait for lender requirements (typically 2-6 months)
5. **Cash-Out Refinance**: Extract capital based on new ARV
6. **Final Analysis**: Calculate ROI on remaining invested capital

## üßÆ Mathematical Formulas

### **Conventional Financing Calculations**

```
Down Payment = Purchase Price √ó (Down Payment % √∑ 100)
Loan Amount = Purchase Price - Down Payment

Monthly Mortgage Payment = [Loan Amount √ó (Monthly Rate √ó (1 + Monthly Rate)^N)] √∑ [(1 + Monthly Rate)^N - 1]
Where: Monthly Rate = (Annual Rate √∑ 100) √∑ 12, N = Loan Term √ó 12

Holding Costs = Monthly Mortgage Payment √ó Renovation Period (months)
Total Cash In = Down Payment + Closing Costs + Improvement Costs + Holding Costs

Monthly Cash Flow = Rent - Mortgage Payment - Monthly Taxes - Insurance - Other Expenses
Annual Cash Flow = Monthly Cash Flow √ó 12
ROI = (Annual Cash Flow √∑ Total Cash In) √ó 100
```

### **HELOC Strategy Calculations**

```
ARV = Purchase Price + (2 √ó Improvement Costs)

Initial Cash In = Purchase Price + Closing Costs + Improvement Costs
HELOC Monthly Payment = [HELOC Amount √ó (Monthly Rate √ó (1 + Monthly Rate)^N)] √∑ [(1 + Monthly Rate)^N - 1]
Total Holding Period = Renovation Period + Seasoning Period
Holding Costs = HELOC Monthly Payment √ó Total Holding Period
Total Cash In = Initial Cash In + Holding Costs

Refinance Logic:
- If Seasoning < 6 months: Refinance Loan = MIN(Purchase Price, 70% of ARV)
- If Seasoning ‚â• 6 months: Refinance Loan = 70% of ARV

Cash Out = Refinance Loan Amount - Refinance Closing Costs
Final Cash In = Total Cash In - Cash Out

Monthly Cash Flow = Rent - Refinance Payment - Monthly Taxes - Insurance - Other - HELOC Payment
Annual Cash Flow = Monthly Cash Flow √ó 12
ROI = (Annual Cash Flow √∑ Final Cash In) √ó 100
```

### **Target Purchase Price Optimization**

The extension uses a **binary search algorithm** to find the optimal purchase price that yields exactly 10% ROI:

```
Conventional Strategy: Search Range = 50% to 120% of asking price
HELOC Strategy: Search Range = 30% to 100% of asking price

For each iteration:
1. Test price = (Low + High) √∑ 2
2. Calculate ROI using test price
3. If ROI < 10%: Adjust high boundary (need lower price)
4. If ROI > 10%: Adjust low boundary (can afford higher price)
5. Converge when |ROI - 10%| < 0.001%
```
